The purpose of this project was to create a hardware interface that is simple from the users perspective. 
In order to accomplish this, the solution handles all binary calculations and spits out nice user friendly enums
that allow for rapid development with the DI2008.

However, this project is NOT designed to be the most efficent or comprehensive solution for special needs situations such as extremely high sampling rates. That being said though everything was set up to be as easy to read and "Hack" as possible so it can be suited to anyones needs with minimal effort.

Along with being easy to use, the entire library is strongly typed which minimizes the chance of errors.

To see this project in action simply plug in a DI2008, load the solution, make sure the Example project is set as the startup project and press F5. The example is brutally simple and demonstrates the simplicity of this solution.

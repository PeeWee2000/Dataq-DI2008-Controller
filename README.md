The purpose of this project is to create a hardware interface that is simple from the users perspective. 
In order to accomplish this, the solution handles all binary calculations and spits out nice user friendly enums
that allow for rapid development with the DI2008.

Along with being easy to use, the entire library is strongly typed which minimizes the chance of errors.
